### Changelog
- **Dec 23** Aidan made boilerplate code (`setup()`, `draw()`, and `Cart`)
- **Jan 05-07** Aidan designed the `Track` class, which uses `Track.Generator` to generate a smoothly changing stream of random `float` values
- **Jan 06-08** Ben created the `VelocityAlgorithm` class which calculates the cart's speed based on forces and energy
- **Jan 08** Aidan added code that calculates velocity based on potential and kinetic energy to the `Cart` class
