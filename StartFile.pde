Instructions:

The goal of the game is to live as long as possible. The cart continues to accelaerate trougout the game, which makes it harder and harder for the player to react to monsters on different paths. Evenetually, it will become impossible to react to a monster, and thye will loose.

 The user has a limited amount of "breaking power." This should be used wisely, to help the cart to decellerate. The best way to decellerate is to 
be in front of a bomb, which pushes you back. If you do not break enough, and you end up in front of the bomb when it explodes, then you will accelrate forward, which is the opposite of what you are trying to accomplish.

the closer you are to the bomb when it explodes, the more you will accelerate. If you are too close, however, you will die.

The coins give you breaking power, and other potential rewards like extra life.


Up/Down Key: Switch between tracks
